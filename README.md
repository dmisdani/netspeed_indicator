### Ubuntu Network indicator
Hi all,

This is an indicator applet to monitor the system network speed and also the network speed per process.
You can also monitor the bandwidth per device (e.g eth0,wlan0, or all of them)
I have tested this on Ubuntu 14.04.

A .deb file is available.
I'll be very happy if you download it,use it, check the python code and extend it.

Cheers!
